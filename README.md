# Get Things Done
This is a simple To-Do list app made using HTML, JS and CSS

This is a simple *"getting comfortable with web development"* kind of a project. There is no databse or anything added as of yet. It is a simple one page web app that
enables users to *create tasks, strike them off once done*, *mark them as undone* or *completely nuke them out*!

The design is kept simple, buttons are used as indicators for the mark and done, undone and delete actions.
Feel free to fork and make additional changes to it or maybe take it a step further and add more functionality to it :)
